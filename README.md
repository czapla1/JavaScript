You are welcome in my short, simple and entertaining game called hanged person (wisielec). The aim of the game is to guess the passwort (one of popural Polish proverb, which is randomly chosen from 10 possible proverbs) in less than 9 attempts. To guess the proverb player must click on letter in the alphabet on th right. When correct letter was clicked it becomes green and it is decrypted in the password. When incorrect letter was chosen it becomes red and the next part of the drawing is revealed. If game player guesses passwort in less then 9 attempt there is applause played and it is possible to start new game. Otherwise, there is hearable 'Damn it!' and again it is possible to start new game.
Have a nice play!
